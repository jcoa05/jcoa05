# Current projects

| Project | Description | Tools | Link |
|---|---|---|---|
| Predicting motor recovery after spinal cord injury using a stacked ensemble | I developed a supervised learning model to predict motor score at 12 months post-injury using data from the first 30 days post-injury on an EMSCI-like simulated dataset. | tidymodels, tune, fastshap | [EMSCI-ML](https://jcoa05.github.io/emsci-ml/) |
| Modelling mosquito-bone disease prevention in France | I analyzed complex survey data on mosquito-borne disease preventive behaviour in France using cummulative link and zero-inflated negative binomial mixed-effect models | lme4, ordinal, glmmTMB | [ELIM-IP](https://github.com/jcoa05/elimip/blob/main/elimip2025.md) |
| Mapping worldwide BSL3-4 labs vulnerable to future climate-related risk | I mapped all BSL3 and BSL4 laboratories worldwide to explore which could be affected by increasing climate-related threats, such as flooding and cyclones, as projected by the IPCC | sf, leaflet | [BSL map](https://github.com/jcoa05/bsl-climate-risk) |


# Past projects

| Project | Description | Tools | Link |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simulating epidemic dynamics using an interactive SE2IR modelling tool | I developed an interactive SE2IR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) modeling tool to simulate epidemic dynamics under varying transmission scenarios. The tool allows users to adjust key parameters (e.g., incubation period, contact rates) and visualize real-time outcomes, aiding in outbreak preparedness and public health decision-making. | shiny, deSolve | [SE2IR tool](https://github.com/jcoa05/seir-shiny) |
| Exploring maternal food consumption via the Pélagie Cohort | I explored the Pélagie cohort, looking at pregnant women and their food consumption via PCA, HRPC, logistic regression analysis, and spatial analysis. | sf, FactoMineR | [Pélagie R script](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n-QfzRHYzvz6knLk0YQ3oKBdQTKulL8g/view?usp=drive_link)|
| Columbus OH Spatial analysis | I explored the ColumbusOH dataset using spatial analysis techniques. | terra, spatialreg | [Columbus R script](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yOd8b_SwdeCeB8sNT8uxPFQ67ySE4Uwx/view?usp=drive_link)|
| AIESEC user dashboard (DEPRECATED) | Multi-source interactive dashboard to inform Operations departments in 27 states at AIESEC Mexico —a global NGO. Source links are severed due to confidentiality. | Looker Studio (ex Google Data Studio) | [Looker Studio dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/lv4_NVGgpaE)|

# Fun fact
When I worked as a cook, I made dinner for José Mujica, former president of Uruguay. He ordered rice, beans, and a piece of chicken —a cheap but tasty Ecuadorean meal.
